        "p1": "Have you heard of a Miyawaki forest, they are also called Tiny forests or pocket forests. They are usually small and planted in cities and used for teaching. Grows faster, stores more CO2, has more biodiversity and are more densely. It started in Japan over 40 years ago, then came to India and later to the Netherlands approx. 5 years ago. In the Netherlands + 110 forests have been planted, but also in France and Belgium. In England, 12 forests are on the way. In Denmark, a couple of these forests will be planted during the autumn, including Jelling and Middelfart. Stay tuned to Miyawaki Skove Danmark. In addition, there are people in several cities who want to plant a forest and who are looking for more volunteers, Randers, Frederikssund, Veksø, Copenhagen, Rødovre etc."
